## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
housing <- read.csv("/home/eeb177-student/Desktop/eeb-177/lab-work/exercise-8_1/Rgraphics/dataSets/landdata-states.csv")
head(housing[1:5])
hist(housing$Home.Value)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(housing, aes(x = Home.Value)) + geom_histogram()
plot(Home.Value ~ Date, data=subset(housing, State == "MA"))
points(Home.Value ~ Date, col="red", data=subset(housing, State == "TX"))
legend(1975, 400000,
       c("MA", "TX"), title="State",
       col=c("black", "red"),
       pch=c(1, 1))
ggplot(subset(housing, State %in% c("MA", "TX")),
       aes(x=Date,
           y=Home.Value,
           color=State))+
  geom_point()
help.search("geom_", package = "ggplot2")
```

```{r}
hp2001Q1 <- subset(housing, Date == 2001.25) 
ggplot(hp2001Q1,
       aes(y = Structure.Cost, x = Land.Value)) +
  geom_point()
```
